Both controller and view restrictions can be nested to allow for an elegant DRY approach to securing your application.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to specify pre-defined restriction trees for your controllers and thus be able to change security allowances without changing your code.\r\n\r\nFinally, you can name controller classes, controller methods and views as resources and determine arbitrarily if access is allowed.  This feature also integrates with the features above to provide specific/generic authorisation scenarios. "

You can safely deploy your HEAD multiple times a day to all of your environments for development, testing, production, whatever. Just use a different set of enabled features.<br/>Feature flags are what Flickr uses to be able to do 10+ deployments to production per day.
